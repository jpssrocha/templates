# Typst template - Simple report

This will generate the layout for a simple report with the common title pages
required on Brazil's universities, summary and bibliography sessions.

## How to use 

To use this template just copy this entire folder to your computer and start
editing the `report.typ` file, compile it using your favorite method (typst
compiler, or 3rth party ones) . The setup function receives the configuration
metadata for formatting the title pages and metadata. Put your references on
the `references.bib` file, or point to your own on the keyword argument for
that in the configuration function.

PS: It isn't necessary to touch the other files, unless you want to customize the
template.
